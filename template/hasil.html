            <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 14px;">Ganyong is one of the food plants that have high nutritional content. The purpose of this study was to determine how to make bioethanol from ganyong tubers using the Solid State Fermentation (SSF) method and determine the price of the Michaelis Menten constant in making bioethanol from ganyong tubers at various pHs with the SSF method. Ganyong tubers are washed with water, peeled, and grated. The results of the grater are squeezed and heated in a pot with a temperature of 100oC for Â± 30 minutes. The ganyong tuber slurry was cooled to continue the fermentation process. Ganyong tuber pulp was taken as much as 250 mL, then added Saccharomyces cerevisiae as much as 10 g, NPK as much as 5 g, urea as much as 5 g, and starter volume as much as 200 mL. The tuber slurry was put into a fermentation vessel and covered to prevent direct contact with air. Samples were analyzed at pH 4, 4.5, and 5 with fermentation time for 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 days. Based on the results of the study, the water content, crude fiber, and starch contained in ganyong tubers were 10.10%, 40.17%, and 0.35%, respectively. The highest glucose content in this study was at fermentation time 0 days with pH 5 of 8.2%. While the highest bioethanol content was 46.08% at pH 4 with a fermentation time of 17 days. The most suitable fermentation reaction kinetics model is Lineweaver and Burk at pH 5 with Km of 94.26 g/L.day and Vmax of 30.66 g/L with R2 of 0.98.</p>
